        Argao is a first municipal income class municipality in the province of Cebu, Philippines. It is located in the southeast of the province of Cebu, 68 km (42 mi) from Cebu City. Argao is exactly midway between Cebu City and the southern tip of Cebu island, Santander. It is comprised of 45 barangays.
        Argao was declared as the top tourist destination in Cebu. This is because of the increasing number of visitors who are interested to see the controversial place. The town is famous for its mouth-watering torta, lip-smacking tableya, and sweet tuba beverage. You must not forget to bring some when you return to your place because these make your stay complete.
        The name Argao dates back to the Spanish period. Locals claim that their hometown got its name from a tree called Sali-argaw, which are abundantly in the coastal areas of place during that time. The town of Argao is considered as one of the oldest towns in the province of Cebu.
